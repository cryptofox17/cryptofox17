# About me~

I started to learn HTML & CSS because I was bored one day and had nothing to do. I realized I really enjoyed making websites so I continued learning and working on personal projects. I also contribute to open source projects sometimes.

Currently I'm learning React and Web Acessibility. 
When I'm not working on websites I draw stuff or read books. I want to keep getting better as an artist and web dev. That's pretty much everything about me :D

Here is [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ce9DwO4EF7aFaO8Ewi0gmIl79bfUWrhL/view?usp=sharing)
